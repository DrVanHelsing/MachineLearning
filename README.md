# MachineLearning
Machine Learning Basics, including Mathematical models behind Machine Learning including Linear, & Logistic Regression, and a Neural Network

This machine learning project focuses on implementing neural networks, covering core concepts like forward propagation, cost function calculation, and backpropagation. Using provided datasets and a detailed notebook, we applied these concepts to tasks involving optimization, multi-class classification, and evaluation. The assignment encouraged experimentation with parameters such as learning rates and polynomial degrees, offering hands-on experience with neural networks and reinforcing theoretical knowledge through practical application
